**🤬The recent craze for overpriced VMD firmware doesn't really match the price tag.**

**😊I did not originate this source code, but I have an obligation to open source it~**

**😄How it hurts the firmware scammers who sell VMD firmware at high prices, and I won't apologise at all for that！**

### How to get help

Official website：https://beater.solutions

discord：https://discord.gg/beater

🔥Beater's DC channel offers free firmware inside (including VMD which is overpriced by many firmware scammers lately), which is enough to deal with any anti-cheat detection and play the games you want to play! There is also a faster and more convenient firmwareflash in the channel, which supports all RS232 and CH347 DMAcards!

## I'll create a detailed VMD guide sometime soon
