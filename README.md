**ðŸ¤¬Beater DC  is a scammer! Since our cooperation began in March, the channel admin has repeatedly delayed paying me for the firmware work I produced. At the beginning of September, when I asked for my payment, he kicked me and other developers out of the server! Beater DC is a fraudster who exploited me and my friends for profit. Donâ€™t fall for his tricks.**
